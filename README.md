## Data source
The analysis was performed using disease prevalence datasets extracted from the "Register for Udvalgte Kroniske Sygdomme og Svære Psykiske Lidelser" (RUKS), data on total population and age distribution in Danish municipalities from Statistikbanken as well as a spatial polygon dataset from the Global Administrative Areas (GADM) database.
